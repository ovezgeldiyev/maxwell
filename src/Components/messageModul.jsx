          I see that there is an issue with low PSI at the wellhead Christmas
          tree. To diagnose the problem, I will need to gather some data. Please
          hold on while I fetch the relevant SCADA data. <br /> Fetching data
          for wellhead pressure, temperature, valve positions, <br /> flow
          rates, and differential pressures... <br />
          <b>Data Analysis:</b> <br /> Based on the initial data, I will analyze
          the following potential <br /> causes: <br /> 1. Master Valve Stuck in
          Position <br /> 2. Debris or Scale Build-up <br /> 3. Hydraulic
          Actuator Malfunction <br /> 4. Low Reservoir Pressure Below Ground{" "}
